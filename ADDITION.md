CompSci 308: SLOGO Addition
===================

##Estimation

####How long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?
Optimistically, adding a turtle selection view will only take an hour to add, since it is a fairly isolated part of the program.

####How many files will you need to add or update? Why?
I know that I need to update at least three: one to create the view, one to add the view to the window, and another to let the turtle actually change shapes. Realistically I'll need to edit more than this if I find bugs, or if I'm misremembering how the program was structured.

##Review

####How long did it take you to complete this new feature?
It took me roughly two hours to add this feature from beginning to end, including testing, which is double of how long I thought it would take, but my initial estimate was not significantly off.

####How many files did you need to add or update? Why?
Github says that I edited seven files, however I only really changed four, the rest were asset tweaks. Out of the four files, the one that I was not expecting was opening a new data access path through an interface, which was a three line addition.

####Did you get it completely right on the first try?
No, I spent more than half of my time debugging dumb problems, since its been a while since last touching this project.


##Analysis

####Was it as good (or bad) as you remembered?
Our team's slogo project actually worked very well. I'm glad it's not like the Voogasalad project, which explodes if any wrong button is pushed. I thought the code quality in our Slogo team was pretty good, and I still think that looking back.

####What could be improved?
Of course, documentation could be improved. It took me 30 minutes just to get my bearings with the old program, and comments and more helpful variable names would've helped a lot with that.

####What would it have been like if you were not familiar with the code at all?
If I had never worked on Slogo before, I'm guessing that this two hour process would have taken at least four. Starting from scratch is much much harder than with a working knowledge, even an old working knowledge. This has really brought home the point of how important it is to document and make readable code.
