###Estimation: before looking at the old code:
*how long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?
I estimate that adding the frontend extension will take about two hours.
*how many files will you need to add or update? Why?
I expect to create a new class that displays a list of turtles as well as modify the GUI class.
###Review: after completing the feature:
*how long did it take you to complete this new feature?
It actually took under an hour and a half.
*how many files did you need to add or update? Why?
I did end up only modifying the GUI class, and it was simply to add a new pane.
*did you get it completely right on the first try?
I got it to work on the first try surprisingly, but it meant that our frontend code was fairly comprehensible.
###Analysis: what do you feel this exercise reveals about your project's design and documentation?
*was it as good (or bad) as you remembered?
Even though our code was not documented with comments, I could still follow the path data travels to the frontend.
*what could be improved?
One aspect that could be improved is allowing the programmer to add panes using a resource bundle, such that the GUI class would be completely closed to modification.
*what would it have been like if you were not familiar with the code at all?
If I were not familiar with the code at all, I might not have realized that the list of turtles are updated asynchronously on every frame, which might require that I spend at least another hour reading through the code to understand it.
